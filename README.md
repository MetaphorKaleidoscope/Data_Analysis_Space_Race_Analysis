### Using an incredibly rich dataset from [nextspaceflight](https://nextspaceflight.com/launches/past/?page=1) that includes all the space missions since the beginning of Space Race between the USA and the Soviet Union in 1957.

### If you want to see the complete step by step with all the details, [follow the instructions](###Instructions).

<h4>Now let's know the status of the missions:</h4>

<h4>How many missions have each Organization?</h4>

<h4>Can it be different?, How many mission by Country?</h4>

<h4>Did the number of missions increase over the years?</h4>

<h4>Interesting, the observed takeoff in the number of missions during the space race. Although after the mid-80's the number of missions decreased considerably, a new spike is observed starting in 2015.

<h4>In this simple graph we can see how historical moments influenced the Space Race, for example, first the struggle between the USA and the USSR for the conquest of space that lasted approximately from 1956 to 1987-89 with the greatest number of missions carried out and Second after the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, the number of missions from what is now Russia has decreased since then.</h4>
